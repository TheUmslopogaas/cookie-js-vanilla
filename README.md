	<h1>This is JS Cookie</h1>
	<p>The cookie, box overlay and the whole markup could be more organized. But don't have the time to refactor the HTML right now. Will do when necessary as per the project requirement.</p>
	<p>This is just to save the snippet so I can use whenever I need without googling or writing from scratch.</p>
	<p>(The cookie expired in 10 seconds though.)</p>
